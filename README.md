# Transball GL by Santiago Ontañón Villar

## Introduction

In the distant future the sun around your planet has died off... The only energy source are the "energy spheres". Each of these spheres contains enough energy for a planet to survive for a whole decade, since they are charged with the energy of other stars.

An opportunist civilization has stolen all the charged spheres from your home planet, preparing for a future invasion. As a last chance, the last remaining sources of energy have been transfered to a scout ship and sent to recover the spheres... this is your last chance of survival!
